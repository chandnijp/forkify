# forkify

Recipe app using an API to search for and like different recipes, view ingredients according to the number of people eating and add the ingredients to a shopping list. I have also implemented persistent data using localStorage, so all recipes and likes are saved on page reloads. 

Technologies Used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6, Food2Fork API, NPM, Babel & Webpack
